This page contains a number of introduction to data science tutorials and a list of resources that I've found helpful to learn data science.


# **R**


The (free) [R for Data Science](http://r4ds.had.co.nz/) by Hadley Wickham is a fantastic resource to learn R.



[These viz + subsetting exercises](R/movies_ggplot_dplyr.html) will give you practice data manipulation and plotting with `dplyr` and `ggplot`. If you are familiar with base R these will be helpful to learn the [tidyverse](http://tidyverse.org/). 

# **Python**

[These viz + subsetting exercises](Python/movies_viz_subsetting.html) will give you practice data manipulation and plotting with `pandas` and `matplotlib`.
