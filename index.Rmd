This page contains a number of introduction to data science tutorials and a list of resources that I've found helpful to learn data science.


# **R**


The (free) [R for Data Science](http://r4ds.had.co.nz/) by Hadley Wickham is a fantastic resource to learn R.



[These viz + subsetting exercises](R/movies_ggplot_dplyr.html) will give you practice data manipulation and plotting with `dplyr` and `ggplot`. If you are familiar with base R these will be helpful to learn the [tidyverse](http://tidyverse.org/). 


# **Python**

If you are new to Python and have some previous programming experience I suggest going through [Google's Python class](https://developers.google.com/edu/python/) to get started with Python. Spend a couple hours working through the class until you get the hang of it. Then download [Anaconda](https://www.continuum.io/downloads) which has most of the stats/machine learning Python packages you'll need. It also comes with [Jupyter notebook](http://jupyter.org/) (formerly iPython) which you should use for data science projects. *Warning*: both Python 2 and 3 are commonly used.




[These viz + subsetting exercises](Python/movies_viz_subsetting.html) will give you practice data manipulation and plotting with `pandas` and `matplotlib`.
